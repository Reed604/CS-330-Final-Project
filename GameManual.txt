Tic-Tac-Toe Game - A client and server socket programing project

Created by Brad Schaeffer and Reed Sanders
----------------------------------------------
How to run ./client-c and ./server-c:
----------------------------------------------
1. You will have to compile a server.c and client.c
2. You will have start the server first by running it. Note the server defaults to port 8888. EXAMPLE: ./server
3. Then you will have to run the client with the server I.P. address and port number. EXAMPLE: ./client SERVER IP 8888
4. Both client and server should provide feedback if working correctly or an error occurs
5. All of these steps can also be done by running the Makefile with the “make” command 
6. After the players are connected the game will begin by asking Player 1 to make their first move

Game Explanation
----------------------------------------------
1) Player 1 will be prompted with a game board and will be asked to enter a grid number. Player one will be assigned a 'X' automatically on the clients game board. 
Player 1's input will be sent over to the server. The server has a copy of the clients game board. Server will autenticate a win. If there is no win yet, the game
will continue.  

Player 1 => X  and  Player 2 => O

*example Board if Player one chose '5'
Player two will chose a grid number. A 'O' will be automatically entered. Player 2's grid choice will be sent over to server to make sure there are no repeats and a win has not occured.
3)If there is no win then the game will continue and Player 1/Player 2 will take turns entering information on the same client.
4)If the server detects 3 in a row, then the game will end and a winner will be awarded.
